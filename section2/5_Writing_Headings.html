      The Socratic method is a way of teaching and learning that relies on
      questioning. Socrates believed that the pursuit of truth and wisdom
      required questioning one's beliefs and assumptions, as well as the beliefs
      and assumptions of others. He is famous for his use of the method in
      conversations with his fellow Athenians, often leading them to question
      their own beliefs and ideas.

      and wisdom, as well as his method of questioning, continue to be studied
      and debated by philosophers and scholars today.

      In conclusion, Socrates' life and philosophy continue to be a source of
      inspiration and intellectual inquiry. His legacy serves as a reminder of
